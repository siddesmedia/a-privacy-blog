What is the importance of alt-tech? We discuss it here.

---

Firstly, Wikipedia, describes alt-tech as "a group of websites, social media platforms, and Internet service providers that position themselves as alternatives to more mainstream offerings" [^1]. With this definition, we can group many companies as alt-tech like [DuckDuckGo](https://duck.com), [Siddes](https://siddes.com), [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org), and [NewTube](https://newtube.app). But, what's the importance of alt-tech? Alt-tech brings privacy, different views, and challenges monopolies. It is important that alt-tech continues to thrive and grow in this world over a few major companies. It is important that we use alt-tech too.

Normally, alt-tech puts privacy first. We can obviously see that with the sites listed above. Alt-tech has changed the way we look at major corporations like Google, Apple, and Microsoft.

Anyway, we created this blog to share our alt-tech and privacy-first view. If you like, go ahead and signup at [siddes.com](https://siddes.com). Its free and does not even require an email!
